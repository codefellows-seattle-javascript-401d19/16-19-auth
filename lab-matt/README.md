`GET /vehicles` => 200 status code if vehicle data based on id is returned </br>
`GET /vehicles` => 401 status code if using a bad token </br>

`POST /images` => 400 status code due to a bad request </br>
`POST /images` => 401 status code due to a bad token </br>
`GET /images/:id` => 200 status code and a json representation of the resource </br>
`GET /images/:id` => 404 status code if there is a bad id given </br>
